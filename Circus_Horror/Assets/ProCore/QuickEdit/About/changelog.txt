-- QuickEdit -

edit: Recalculate collider dimensions on exiting edit mode. Fixed #59
edit: Use a unique asset path when copying mesh data to the project. Fixed #63
edit: Use a TRS class to store position, rotation, and scale of objects so that vertices are updated on all possible changes.  We get rotation support for free with this change - scale remains intransigent.
edit: Remove no longer necessary VertHandlePrefab.  Don't use an if switch in OnDrawGizmos, instead, use the directives specifically designed for designating gizmos on selection / pickables.
